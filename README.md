# Stress De-Buster  

## üìå Overview  
Stress De-Buster operates by capturing real-time facial images using a webcam and analyzing facial expressions through a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model identifies stress levels based on facial features and expressions, providing an accurate assessment of the user's emotional state. Once the stress level is determined, the application suggests appropriate stress-relieving activities to help the user relax and improve their mental well-being. These activities include playing calming music or nature sounds, engaging in interactive games such as Snake & Ladder or Tic Tac Toe, displaying humorous memes to uplift the mood, guiding users through mindfulness exercises and meditation, and sending productivity insights with break reminders to promote a balanced workflow.

Additionally, the system integrates with wearable devices such as smartwatches to track real-time physiological stress indicators, including heart rate variations and skin conductance. This feature enhances the accuracy of stress detection and allows users to monitor their stress levels comprehensively. The application also maintains a log of user activity and stress levels over time, enabling users to track their emotional patterns and make necessary lifestyle adjustments. By combining machine learning, real-time data tracking, and engaging activities, Stress De-Buster provides a holistic approach to stress management, ensuring users can effectively manage stress and enhance their overall well-being.
